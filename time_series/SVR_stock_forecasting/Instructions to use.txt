NOTE: These python codes have been developed in spyder with support of anaconda. So suggested
	to use any suitable environment but preferably spyder for better support from my side.

NOTE: please use attached csv file because it's been formated as per requirement as well as per se online 
	stock market spreadsheet format. 

STEPS:

1. These are interactive codes where you have to enter "date/month/year/what to predict".

2. open these python files in spyder and run it or just double click to execute these script file. Enter suitable required input.

3. If any error is popping out then it signifies that datapoints of following date/month 
	doesn't exist. If error still persist, please let me know.

4. Graph visualisation is available in spyder so I expect graph to be shown in other environments
	like MICROSOFT VS CODE, command prompt OR ANY OTHER as well.

NOTE: Have a good day :-)
